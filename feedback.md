***My Response***

Working on this project gave me valuable insight into structuring Laravel applications in a more scalable and maintainable way. While I successfully implemented the core functionality, validation, and automated tests, the feedback I received helped me understand where I can improve — particularly around following Laravel’s recommended design patterns and separation of concerns.

In future iterations, I plan to introduce Service classes to handle business logic (for example, encapsulating the booking process into a dedicated BookingService), Repository classes to abstract database operations, and Form Request classes to manage validation more cleanly. I’ll also focus on adding clearer inline documentation and PHPDoc comments to improve readability and maintainability for other developers.

Overall, this project strengthened my understanding of Laravel’s architecture and gave me a clearer picture of how to organize code that scales well as applications grow in complexity.


***Feedback***
Thanks for taking the time to complete the technical test provided. Unfortunately on this occasion you have not been successful.
After reviewing your project, we found that while you demonstrated a good understanding of PHP, JavaScript, and package management tools, there were some areas for improvement which we feel will help you in future applications:

*Design patterns: The implementation did not consistently follow Laravel recommended design patterns, such as proper use of Service Providers, Repositories, and Dependency Injection.
*Code structure: Some files lacked clear separation of concerns, making the codebase harder to maintain and extend.
*Documentation: The project would benefit from more comprehensive comments and documentation to improve readability for other developers.
*We would encourage you to focus on these areas in future projects to strengthen your application.
